# Variable in Javascript:
1) Javascript is dynamically typed checked.
2)case sensitive.i.e A and a is different.
3)varibles name should allows=> _(Underscore),letter ,digits or $ ,not with spaces. 
4)Allow to start with only $,digits or _(Underscore)
5)reserved name not be an variable.

eg=>/*
variable rule=>this is not works with variable name b'z its a reserved keword in js.
console="mera badla";
console.log("console");//error on browser=>console.log is not a function.

2)Console= "mera badla"; perfectly valid case sensitive

console.log(Console);
*/

##let,const and var==>
NOTE=>we always go with let/const.
#let=> variable cannot be redeclared or but can be upadated.
#const =>Variable cannot be redeclared or updated .A block Scope Variable.

#var=>variable which can be redeclared & updated.It has a global scope.

============================================================================
## DATATYPES IN JAVASCRIPT:##
==>Number,String,Boolean,Undefined,BigInt,Null,Symbol

object creation in js=>should be in key:value pair
eg .student{
fullName:"yogesh patil",
age:28,
cgpa:8.5,
city:"navi mumbai"
};

to access the objects key =>eg. 1)either by this way =>console.log(student.age )
2)or by this way=>console.log(student["age"]);

3)Note=>we know we cn update let but not const variable in js.
but we can update object which we declared as const ,it's rule why? we see it later.and 
now just note in memory.but we need to update whole object (change it's memory)not just an single key.
we can see it further.in object related chapter.

string="abcd"+1; //strings in js are unique things they are appends if we use + sign not add
//console.log(string)=>abcd1
